# Feel Good Gym overview

At Feel Good Gym, we believe that fitness is more than just exercise — it’s a lifestyle dedicated to strength, energy, and balance. Taking care of your body means investing in your long-term health, confidence, and happiness.

Regular workouts help you build muscle, burn fat, and improve flexibility, but the real benefits go beyond the mirror. Staying active boosts your mood, sharpens focus, and reduces stress, helping you feel better every day. Whether you enjoy lifting weights, joining group classes, or taking part in personal training sessions, every movement brings you one step closer to your goals.

Nutrition, rest, and mindset are just as important. That’s why we encourage a holistic approach — combining effective training programs with healthy eating habits and proper recovery. Our certified trainers and nutrition advisors are here to guide you, motivate you, and make sure your fitness journey is safe and enjoyable.

At Feel Good Gym, we’re not just helping you get fit — we’re helping you build a stronger, healthier version of yourself.

## Testing

**Home page**

![TV Monitor](./assets/images/testingpart1/image.png)

I started my testing with large screen resolution but everthing works as it should be but my intention is to do the testing on different media. That is the real challenge where my code needs to cope with all the different screen configurations and resolutions.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
